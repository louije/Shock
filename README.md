# Shock.app

Provides a full-screen overlay to type messages in large text.
Useful, perhaps, for silent communications among coworkers.

Currently uses a WebView (the deprecated kind) to do its thing.

## TODO

- [ ] Replace WebView with WKWebView
- [ ] Enhance the actual display of text (autosizing and all)
- [ ] Turn into a menu-bar item with a keyboard shortcut as trigger
- [ ] Keyboard handling bugs

## Caveat

Very obviously a work in slow, slow progress.
